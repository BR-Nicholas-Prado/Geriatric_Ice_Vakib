== Delete service package

* assignee : Nicholas Prado
* status : to do
* priority : medium

I copy the gzipped tar file containing the service jars for a given client to the same folder.
However, gvakib can only delete jar files.
I could rename them, but then I'd have done the equivalent of deleting them by hand.

Provide some means of indicating that the session should search for a different file extension than jar.
Consider using a startup argument.
