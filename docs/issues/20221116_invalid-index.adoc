== Reject invalid index

* assignee : Nicholas Prado
* status : to do
* priority : medium

Givakib offered options 1-12, but the folder names were 3-15.
I typed in `t 1-15`.
This deleted all twelve jars.
I meant to type in 1-6; because of the lexical sorting, 15 was the sixth element.
15 was not a valid index.

Reject a request that includes an invalid positive index.
(It already rejects negative indicies.)
